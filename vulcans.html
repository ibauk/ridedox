      The ride protocols described in the
      <a href="riderguidance.html">Rider Guidance document</a> and the
      <a href="ridesubmit.html">Ride Documentation pack</a> must be strictly
      applied.

      On 2nd April 1982 Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Over the
      following 10 weeks UK Military Forces were mobilised and liberated the
      Falkland Islands. Part of the Military Response were the Black Buck
      bombing raids by Vulcan Bombers, the longest bombing missions ever
      attempted at the time. There are currently 15 Vulcans in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vulcan ride aims to visit the 13 of these accessible from a public
      highway. XH558 is inside a hangar but the others are kept outside. Serial
      numbers XJ824, XL318 (not included in the ride) are on display indoors at
      Imperial War Museum, Duxford and RAF Museum, Colindale respectively.

    <h2>The Vulcan Rides Rules</h2>
    <p>The Vulcan series of rides consists of:</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      <strong>Vulcan NEWS</strong>: Visit at least the four "corner" Vulcans
      while riding 1000 miles in 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      <strong>Vulcan Gold</strong>: Visit all 13 Vulcans while riding 1000 miles
      in 24 hours.
    </p>
    <!-- Basic ride rules vJan24 -->
    <p>The basic rules are the same as for other IBA UK rides:</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      1. Ride the designated distance in the designated time (see below) on a
      safe route of your choice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      2. IBA UK requires that you document your ride with photographs. The photo
      must show BOTH the receipt AND your bike's odometer (mileage) reading IN
      THE SAME PHOTO. Receipts and odo readings must be legible. Record the
      Start and End details on Ride Documentation 2 and Ride Documentation 3
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      3. Collect fuel and other receipts along your route and photograph each
      against your odometer. Track them, along with rest stops over 30 minutes,
      on Ride Documentation 4.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      4. Complete all the remaining documentation in the Ride Documentation
      pack.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      5. Copy all completed documentation and receipts and submit the copies,
      with your name on every sheet.
    </p>
    <!-- End basic ride rules -->

    <h2>Additional rules</h2>
    <p>

      rides should do the same.

      </li>
      <li>
        The Vulcan sites must be visited in order, either clockwise or
        anticlockwise but not both.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must make a "ride flag" using the image (colour/black&amp;white) on
        page 1 of this document and customise it using your name or other
        identifier. The flag will need to be included in all Vulcan photos.
      </li>
