    <h1>The BunBurner Rides and Rules</h1>
    <img class="logo" src="ibauklogo.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      BunBurner rides are only available to IBA members who have completed a
      certified SS1000/SS1600K.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ride protocols described in the Rider Guidance document and the Ride
      Documentation pack must be strictly applied.
    </p>
    <p>The BunBurner series of rides consists of:</p>
    <p class="indent1">BunBurner 1500 (BB1500) or BunBurner 2500K (BB2500K)</p>
    <p class="indent2">1500 miles/2500kms in 36 hours</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      BunBurner 1500 SILVER (BBS) or BunBurner 2500K SILVER (BBS2500K)
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">1500 miles/2500kms in 30 hours</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      BunBurner GOLD (BBG) or BunBurner 2500K GOLD (BBG2500K).
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">1500 miles/2500kms in 24 hours</p>
    <p class="indent2">
      The SILVER/GOLD rides are extreme rides and it is expected that riders
      attempting these rides have already completed at least an SS1000 or
      SS1600K.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      BunBurner GOLD 3000 (BBG3000) or BunBurner GOLD 5000K (BBG5000K)
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
      It is expected that riders attempting these rides have already completed
      at least BBG, SS2000 or BBG2500K. Other rides may qualify and advice is
      available from verifications@ironbutt.co.uk
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
      The BBG3000 is 2 consecutive BBG (1500 mile) rides in 48 hours, with the
      first leg of 1500 miles being completed in 24 hours and the second leg
      completed in the second 24 hour period, in no more than 48 hours over all.
      It is important to note that time left over from the first leg may not be
      used to lengthen the time for the second leg.
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
      The mid-point between the 2 legs should be carefully considered. The
      ending time of the first leg may be used as the starting time of the
      second leg, but this sacrifices the remaining time of the first leg which
      may be used for rest. A rider may also rest beyond the maximum time for
      the first leg but the clock for the second leg AUTOMATICALLY starts no
      later than 24hours after the start of the first leg, irrespective of
      whether the rider is actually on the road or not.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      Please Note: Riders wishing to claim triple BBGs should first seek advice
      from

    <h2>BUNBURNER RULES</h2>

      1. Ride the designated distance in the designated time (see below) on a
      safe route of your choice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      2. IBAUK requires that you document your ride with photographs. The photo
      must show BOTH the receipt AND your bike's odometer (mileage) reading IN
      THE SAME PHOTO. Receipts and odo readings must be legible. Record the
      Start and End details on Ride Documentation 2 and Ride Documentation 3
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      3. Collect fuel and other receipts along your route and photograph each
      against your odometer. Track them, along with rest stops over 30 minutes,
      on Ride Documentation 4.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      4. Complete all the remaining documentation in the Ride Documentation
      pack.
    </p>
