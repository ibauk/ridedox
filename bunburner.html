    <h1>The Bun Burner Rides and Rules</h1>
    <img class="logo" src="ibauklogo.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      Bun Burner rides are only available to IBA members who have completed a
      certified SS1000/SS1600K.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ride protocols described in the
      <a href="riderguidance.html">Rider Guidance document</a> and the
      <a href="ridesubmit.html">Ride Documentation pack</a> must be strictly
      applied.
    </p>
    <p>The Bun Burner series of rides consists of:</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      Bun Burner 1500 (BB1500) or Bun Burner 2500K (BB2500K)
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">1500 miles/2500kms in 36 hours</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      The SILVER/GOLD rides below are extreme rides and to qualify for these
      rides you must have had a previous Iron Butt ride successfully certified.
    </p>

    <p class="indent1">
      Bun Burner 1500 SILVER (BBS) or Bun Burner 2500K SILVER (BBS2500K)
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">1500 miles/2500kms in 30 hours</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      Bun Burner GOLD (BBG) or Bun Burner 2500K GOLD (BBG2500K).
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">1500 miles/2500kms in 24 hours</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      Bun Burner GOLD 3000 (BBG3000) or Bun Burner GOLD 5000K (BBG5000K)
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
      The BBG3000 is 2 consecutive BBG rides in 48 hours, with the first leg of
      1500 miles being completed in 24 hours and the second leg completed in the
      second 24 hour period, in no more than 48 hours over all. It is important
      to note that time left over from the first leg may not be used to lengthen
      the time for the second leg.
    </p>
    <p class="indent2">
      The mid-point between the 2 legs should be carefully considered. The
      finish time of the first leg may be used as the start time of the second
      leg, but this sacrifices the remaining time of the first leg which may be
      used for rest. A rider may also rest beyond the maximum time for the first
      leg but the clock for the second leg AUTOMATICALLY starts no later than
      24hours after the start of the first leg, whether the rider is actually on
      the road or not.
    </p>
    <h2>Bun Burner RULES</h2>
    <!-- Basic ride rules vJan24 -->
    <p>The basic rules are the same as for other IBA UK rides:</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      1. Ride the designated distance in the designated time (see below) on a
      safe route of your choice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      2. IBA UK requires that you document your ride with photographs. The photo
      must show BOTH the receipt AND your bike's odometer (mileage) reading IN
      THE SAME PHOTO. Receipts and odo readings must be legible. Record the
      Start and End details on Ride Documentation 2 and Ride Documentation 3
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      3. Collect fuel and other receipts along your route and photograph each
      against your odometer. Track them, along with rest stops over 30 minutes,
      on Ride Documentation 4.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      4. Complete all the remaining documentation in the Ride Documentation
      pack.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      5. Copy all completed documentation and receipts and submit the copies,
      with your name on every sheet.
