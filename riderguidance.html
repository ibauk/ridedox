    <h1>Rider Guidance</h1>
    <img class="logo" src="ibauklogo.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      Although the following protocols apply to all IBA UK rides, this guidance
      is aimed at riders undertaking the entry level rides, so as to ensure a
      successful first ride. Entry level rides to the IBA UK will normally be
      either SaddleSore 1000 or SaddleSore 1600K.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may complete any ride two-up with one person doing all the piloting,
      the other being a pillion the entire distance - you may not share piloting
      duties! In these cases, the Iron Butt Association issues two certificates,
      one for the rider and one for the pillion. There is no additional charge
      for a pillion but if they would like a pin badge or plate frame, you will
      need to include that with the fee after verification.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Plan a safe route</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A safe ride should be your primary goal. If this is your first attempt
        at a 1000 mile day, we highly recommend that you study the Iron Butt
        Association's long distance riding tips in the "Archive of Wisdom"
        currently located at
        <a href="https://ironbutt.org/25tips.html"
          >https://ironbutt.org/25tips.html</a
        >
        and our own
        <a href="https://ironbutt.co.uk/firstukride.php"
          >First UK Iron Butt Ride</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since safety is our primary concern, no pre-registration of your ride is
        needed. Our goal is to give you maximum flexibility to decide on any
        given day whether the combination of weather, your motorcycle and, most
        importantly, your attitude, are ready for a big ride. We also feel this
        removes the pressure to complete the ride should you become tired or
        otherwise feel unsafe.
      </li>
      <li>
        IMPORTANT NOTE: Unless your speedometer has been calibrated, do NOT
        depend on your own odometer readings for official mileage! Many perhaps
        most motorcycles register at least 4% more miles than actually
        travelled. Over the course of a 24 hour period, this error can be quite
        severe - as much as 40 miles. In all cases, mileage will be verified
        using one or more standard route-mapping programs such as Garmin
        BaseCamp, Google Maps, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        We strongly discourage, and in some cases may reject, routes which are
        repetitive in nature. For example, we would not accept a claim that you
        rode from Leeds to Leicester and back (about 200 miles) five times. If
        you choose a circular route, you will need to obtain a dated receipt at
        each "corner", i.e. change of direction, to show that you did not take a
        short-cut. For example, if you choose to ride the circular route of
        London, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff, London we would expect to receive
        receipts from each of those locations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you choose a route where you ride 500 miles and then turn around and
        come back, you must get a dated receipt at the turn-around point. For
        example, if you were to start in Dover and ride to John O'Groats and
        back to Dover, we would expect a detailed receipt from John O'Groats.
        The "End to End Club" stamps available at John O'Groats and Land's End
        are not acceptable as substitutes for the dated receipts.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your route includes any toll roads/bridges, where possible try and
        obtain a receipt from either the beginning or the end of the toll
        section and log it along with your other receipts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Motorcycling comes with risk and riding 1,000 miles or more increases
        your risk substantially. It is imperative you understand the risk you
        are taking and minimize the possibility of an accident by practising
        safe motorcycle habits. No one, not even the most experienced long
        distance rider, can safely fight off fatigue. If you are tired, the only
        option is to stop and rest. Ignoring the symptoms of fatigue can be
        fatal. The SaddleSore rides enjoy a fantastic safety record but to
        continue this record requires you to do your part. If you are tired,
        having a bad day, or facing other hurdles which are impacting your
        riding skills, please stop and rest so that you may enjoy motorcycling
        another day!
      </li>
      <li>
        While group SaddleSore rides bring with them the safety of group travel,
        they can also increase your risk by encouraging you to press on when you
        might otherwise stop. Group rides can also encourage aggressive riding.
        Be sure riding styles of others in your group match your style. When
        planning a ride, keep in mind that group rides are only as fast as the
        slowest person in the group. This can extend your riding day many hours
        pushing you towards fatigue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please remember that the Iron Butt Association is dedicated to the sport
        of safe, long-distance motorcycle riding. It does not condone, nor will
        it tolerate, unsafe activities such as excessive speed, reckless
        motorcycle operation, riding while fatigued or otherwise impaired, the
        use of stimulants to maintain alertness, or any other activity that
        results in riders exceeding their personal limits. In many countries,
        riding more than 20 miles per hour above the speed limit may also get
        you charged with dangerous driving. Dangerous driving is a serious
        charge in any jurisdiction. Few experiences in motorcycling are more
        memorable than an appearance in traffic court, particularly if your
        license hangs on the outcome.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any rider found to have engaged in, or claiming to have engaged in,
        these or other unsafe activities, as determined at the sole discretion
        of the IBA, will have their certification refused. If the certification
        is already issued and we find out about these infractions after the
        fact, the certification will be revoked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please keep in mind that the time stated for your chosen ride is wall
        time, not riding time. So, for example with SS1000 (24 hours), if you
        start your ride at 5:00 pm on June 1st, you must finish it before 5.00
        pm on June 2nd.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are attempting a ride exceeding 1000 miles in 24 hours and you
        miss the 24 hour deadline, but have achieved 1000 miles before
        abandoning the longer ride, it is still possible to submit that 1000
        mile distance as a SaddleSore 1000.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Document start &amp; finish</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        IBAUK requires that you document your ride with receipts and
        photographs. The photos must show BOTH the receipt AND your bike's
        odometer (mileage) reading IN THE SAME PHOTO. Receipts and odo readings
        must be legible.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a pillion is on the ride with you, please make sure they are recorded
        on the documentation. (Ride Documentation 1b 2, 3)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <img src="rgreceiptodo.png" alt="*" />
    <div>
      To be clear about the odo/receipt photo, this is a good example. Note
      that:-
      <ul>
        <li>Bike's live odometer is visible</li>
        <li>Receipt has site location visible</li>
        <li>Receipt has date/time visible</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>3. Collect and track receipts</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The start and end times of your ride are determined by computer printed
        receipts which clearly show the date, time and location. This can be a
        fuel receipt, an ATM receipt, or any other computer printed receipt
        which clearly states all this information. Please note that some ATMs do
        not print the location. Please check because any receipt without a
        location is not acceptable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >The time on the computer printed fuel receipt or the ATM receipt will
          be your only official start time.</strong
        >
        Witness statements alone will not be accepted as a substitute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Although a clear date and time are most important for your start and end
        receipts, they are much less critical on the other ride receipts. We
        know there are mistakes on many petrol station clocks - spend your time
        concentrating on the start and end receipts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be aware that many fuel stations in Europe are printing an "invoice
        number" which is actually the time of the transaction e.g. you might see
        Inv# 113557 which means 11:35:57 am.
      </li>
      <li>
        The mapping programs used by the verifiers may not always recognise
        addresses and postcodes printed on receipts obtained in continental
        Europe. Please help the verifiers by writing a note on the receipt
        giving approximate location, e.g. "On E34 2 miles south of J30, near
        Herford".
      </li>
      <li>
        A log entry (Ride Documentation 4), must be made at each stop. A receipt
        must accompany each log entry other than rest stops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Log entries should be numbered in chronological order, with the starting
        time receipt at number 1, and include the date, time, location (e.g.
        London) and odometer reading.
      </li>
      <li>
        The following log entries are mandatory:-
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Stops</strong> Receipts from fuel & other stops, where
            possible, should include a printed date. Time stamps on receipts
            other than start and finish receipts are not critical so do not
            waste time worrying about them. WARNING: If your motorcycle is
            equipped with a large fuel-tank, please note that you must stop at
            least once every 350 miles anyway (this is purely for documentation
            for your ride). Although we know it is possible to ride greater
            distances non-stop, we will not accept a claim of this type.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rest stops over 30 minutes</strong>: In order for the
            verification team to account for your time, log entries must be made
            at each stop longer than 30 minutes, whether that is for a short nap
            at a roadside rest area, or longer in a hotel room. Some stops, e.g.
            a stop in a rest area, will not generate any kind of receipt - this
            is acceptable, but please account for the time in your trip log by
            including the approximate length of the stop or the start time and
            ending time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meal breaks</strong> taking longer than 30 minutes are also
            considered to be rest stops. Where possible obtain a computer
            printed receipt from a restaurant.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the end of your ride, before the time period is up, obtain a
            computer printed fuel, ATM receipt or other computer printed receipt
            with a legible location, date and time stamp.
            <strong
              >The time on this receipt will be your only official finish
              time</strong
            >.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Prepare, copy and submit your documentation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Please ensure you use the correct Ride Documentation, as downloaded from
        the IBA UK website. This is different from the USA equivalent which is
        found on other websites
      </li>
      <li>
        The onus is on the rider to present the evidence that they have
        completed the ride within the rules. This will be achieved as follows:
      </li>
      <li>
        Find a map (an old, or photocopied one is acceptable) or print one from
        the internet and circle your start and end points and the locations you
        stopped in for fuel/food/etc. This map is to assist the person verifying
        the routes and is meant to give a good overall picture of your ride. You
        do not actually have to find the small towns you stopped in, just circle
        the approximate area. The best map is one that shows your route on one
        or two pages. Please do not send in multi-page route sheets from mapping
        programs or an Auto club because they are too hard for the verification
        team to get a good overview of your ride.
      </li>
      <li>
        COPY your receipts and number the copies to correspond to your trip log.
      </li>
      <li>
        COPY your log.<br />
        <strong
          >Always retain your original documentation and submit only
          copies.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have used a satellite tracker e.g. SPOT, Bubbler GPS, etc, you
        may also submit the associated Spotwalla link (but NOT the print-out) as
        supporting evidence.
      </li>
      <li>
        If needed, write a short note about any problems with your ride on Ride
        Documentation 5. For example, "The receipt from Birch Services does not
        have the correct date. I had the attendant write the correct date. The
        station's number is 01706 123 1234"
      </li>
      <li>
        We strongly caution that out on the road it may not be possible to
        follow these guidelines to the letter. If that happens, please explain
        any problem you encountered and we will do our best to work out a
        solution. For example, 23 hours and 35 minutes into his 24 hour ride,
        one person could not find a petrol station with a computer printed
        receipt (obviously, our favourite type), so he got some local people to
        witness the time he arrived. His other documents clearly supported his
        claim of riding the distance in the time-frame he claimed so we did not
        hesitate to process his award.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete Ride Documentation 1a (and 1b if you have a pillion). This
        information tells us where to send the awards, the name and motorcycle
        you would like on the certificate and the basic route you would like the
        award to note.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the Rider Declaration (Ride Documentation 6). No Fee is due at
        this stage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, send it to:-<br />
        <br />
        <address>
          IBA UK,<br />
          Darryll Kirk<br />
          95 Wymeswold Road<br />
          Hoton<br />
          Loughborough LE12 5SN
        </address>
        <br />
        Or e-mail scanned documents to
        <a href="mailto:verifications@ironbutt.co.uk"
          >verifications@ironbutt.co.uk</a
        >
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>You will receive confirmation of your documentation being received.</p>
    <p>
      When we get your ride documentation, one of several people will start the
      verification process. Due to the extensive work involved (keying data into
      mileage spreadsheets, map verifications, witness contacts where needed and
      custom certificate preparations) and the fact that 100% of the labour
      involved with producing these awards is performed by volunteers, it will
      usually take a minimum of 1 month before your certificates will be ready
      for signature and mailed to you. We realise this is a long time to wait
      for your certification but our certification process is very thorough. In
      fact, the entire certification process is what gives your certificate its
      value. It would be very easy for the Iron Butt Association to simply take
      your money and print up, for example, a generic "you rode a 1,000 mile
      day" certificate. However, the value of the entire certification program
      is in the fact that not just anyone can get an Iron Butt Association ride
      certificate. The downside is that this process takes time. We can only
      offer that when you receive your certificate you know not only that you
      earned it, but so did any other rider that you meet with the same
      certificate. Before we can issue your certificate, you may be asked to
      clarify certain aspects of your ride and/or documentation by either
      e-mail, phone or letter. Additionally, certain aspects of your ride may be
      subject to audit by yet another set of IBA volunteers charged with
      ensuring only people who rode the miles get the award. Should your package
      get tagged for that audit, it may delay your claim for the award.
    </p>
    <p>
      The protocols explained in this document are the only ones against which
      IBA UK rides are assessed. Failure to comply with them may result in your
      ride being rejected, so make sure you are 100% certain you understand the
      rules and the guidance before you start your ride. If you have any
      questions about any aspect of your proposed ride we will help you. Please
      e-mail to
      <a href="mailto:verifications@ironbutt.co.uk"
        >verifications@ironbutt.co.uk</a
