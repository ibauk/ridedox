    <p>
        If you are not already a member of the Iron Butt Association, the SS1000 is an entry level ride into IBA long distance riding and will gain you membership of the IBA UK. 
      The ride protocols described in the <a href="riderguidance.html">Rider Guidance document</a> and the <a href="ridesubmit.html">Ride Documentation pack</a> must be strictly applied.
    </p>
    <p>The SaddleSore series of rides consists of:</p>
    <p class="indent1">SS1000
    <span class="indent2">1000 miles in 24 hours</span></p>
    <p class="indent1">SS2000    
    <span class="indent2">2000 miles in 48 hours</span></p>
    <p class="indent1">SS3000
    <span class="indent2">3000 miles in 72 hours</span></p>
    <p class="indent1">SS4000
      <span class="indent2">4000 miles in 4 days</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">SS5000
      <span class="indent2">5000 miles in 5 days</span>
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">SS9000
      <span class="indent2">9000 miles in 9 days</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The SaddleSore rides are also available in the metric equivalents, which include K after the number: SS1600K, SS2000K (both in 24 hours); and various other kilometre distance rides are ridden around the world. Basically, rides in the UK are done in MILES while rides in Europe may be done in either MILES or KILOMETRES.
    </p>
    <p>
      With SS2000 and above there are no restrictions on how the miles are apportioned on the number of days.
