    <p>
      If you are not already a member of the Iron Butt Association, the UK
      End2End is an entry level ride into IBA long distance riding and will gain
      you membership of the IBA UK. You will need to have an
      SS1000/SS1600k/End2End certified before attempting longer rides. The ride
      protocols described in the
      <a href="riderguidance.html">Rider Guidance document</a> and the
      <a href="ridesubmit.html">Ride Documentation pack</a> must be strictly
      applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two End to End rides which can be completed in the UK. These
      involve riding between Land's End in Cornwall and John O'Groats in north
      east Scotland, or vice versa. If you arrive outside normal trading hours
      and are unable to obtain start or end receipts at Land's End, a receipt
      from Penzance 24 hour petrol station will be accepted, and will add 10
      miles and 15 minutes to your ride. Likewise, if unable to obtain a start
      or end receipt at John O'Groats a receipt from Wick 24 hour petrol station
      will be acceptable, and will add 16 miles and 20 minutes to your ride.
    </p>
    <p>The End2End series of rides consists of:</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      <strong>UK End2End</strong>: an E2E must start at LE or JOG, end at JOG or
      LE, and cover at least 1,000 miles between the two. What route you take to
      make it up to 1,000 miles is entirely up to you; one option would be to
      include receipts from Gordano services, near Bristol, and Clacket Lane
      eastbound services, south of London.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      <strong>UK End2End GOLD (E2E GOLD)</strong>: To qualify for a Gold award,
      the ride between the two ends must cover at least 1,250 miles. As with
      other Gold rides, it is required that riders attempting this ride have
      already completed at least an SS1000, SS1600K or End2End. If you are
      unsure, please contact
