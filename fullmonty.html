    <p>
      To qualify for this ride you must have had a previous Iron Butt ride
      successfully certified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ride protocols described in the
      <a href="riderguidance.html">Rider Guidance document</a> and the
      <a href="ridesubmit.html">Ride Documentation pack</a> must be strictly
      applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ride can start from any location you choose. A time dated receipt
      will be required to verify when and where you started from. The ride must
      visit the following UK "corners":-
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Land's End, Cornwall</li>
      <li>St David's, Wales</li>
      <li>John O'Groats, Scotland</li>
      <li>Lowestoft, Suffolk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is understood that these locations may not necessarily be the
      geographical land extremities, but they must be visited in either a
      clockwise or anti-clockwise direction after the first one has been
      documented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Return to your original start location to obtain a time dated finish
      receipt, all within 48 hours. Regardless of where you start and which
      route you take you will always ride well over 2000 miles.
    </p>

    <h2>THE FULL MONTY RULES</h2>
    <!-- Basic ride rules vJan24 -->
    <p>The basic rules are the same as for other IBA UK rides:</p>
    <p class="indent1">
      1. Ride the designated distance in the designated time (see below) on a
      safe route of your choice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      2. IBA UK requires that you document your ride with photographs. The photo
      must show BOTH the receipt AND your bike's odometer (mileage) reading IN
      THE SAME PHOTO. Receipts and odo readings must be legible. Record the
      Start and End details on Ride Documentation 2 and Ride Documentation 3
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      3. Collect fuel and other receipts along your route and photograph each
      against your odometer. Track them, along with rest stops over 30 minutes,
      on Ride Documentation 4.
    </p>
    <p class="indent1">
      4. Complete all the remaining documentation in the Ride Documentation
      pack.
